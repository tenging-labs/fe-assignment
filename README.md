# Tenging Front-end Assignment
Welcome to Tenging Front-end coding assignment. The purpose of this assignmnet is to help us evaluate your VueJS and development skills.

There is no wrong or right way of completing this task. We only ask to use TypeScript and final code quality should meet production quality standards.

## Task
- Create simple Kanban board:
    - Use [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar)
    - Use [Vue-dndrop](https://amendx.github.io/vue-dndrop/)
- Must have:
    - Responsive functionality - Kanban board columns on smaller screens (mobile) should have a horizontal scroll, yet the ability to drag and drop items from one column to another should persist.
- Bonus points for:
    - Linting rules
    - Working filtering (using local state)
    - Alternative solution to responsive Kanban with pleasant UI/UX.
